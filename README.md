# Investment Tracker Web Application

This is an ongoing project, which is being done with the aim of creating a Flask application that allows users to register and then track investments on a dashboard (stock indices, bond indices, individual stocks), as well as plotting their own investment returns over time and estimating future returns. 

## How the application will work
1. The homepage of the application includes a dashboard showing the daily performance of a selection of global stock and bond indices.
1. By registering with the application, the user can add or remove investments from the dashboard (the investments associated with each user will be stored in a database).
1. The application will automatically update the database and dashboard with the daily performance of each investment that the user is tracking.
1. Separate webpages will be provided to allow the user to log and plot their own investment results over time (split based on asset allocation) and estimate future returns.
